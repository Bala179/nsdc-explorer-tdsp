# NSDC Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP)
This repository contains my code for the NSDC Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP) organized by the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub.

During the course of this project, I completed six milestones:
1. Data Preparation
2. Data Ethics, Pre-Processing, and Exploration
3. Time Series Analysis
4. Geospatial Analysis
5. Answering a Self-Guided Research Question
6. Virtual Poster Board Creation: Data Storytelling

The research question I aimed to answer was whether or not the geometric features of an intersection affected the number of crashes/fatalities/injuries that occurred in Lower Manhattan. Using a dataset on motor vehicle collisions from NYC Open Data, I randomly sampled some of the crashes and plotted them on a map of NYC. After this, I manually analyzed whether each intersection was perpendicular or skewed. My conclusion was that perpendicular intersections were larger sources of crashes, injuries, and fatalities than skewed intersections, and I also provided some recommendations to the Department of Transportation on how crashes could be minimized at these locations.

The poster that I made for the project can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KNojENBm8oc-MXTQlX5PsMsurdLMZfxN/view?usp=sharing).
